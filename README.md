# WeddingVenueAnalysis
This is a project designed to provide decision making support when analyzing wedding venue options in Los Angeles. 

Two tools have been created for this purpose. First, a web scraper to scrape wedding venue price and name details from the Wedding Wire website (a popular marketplace for wedding venues and vendors) and export the file locally as a csv. Second, the scraped wedding venue data is used in a dynamic dashboard to see location, price, and comparison details across venue sectors.

I've focused on the Los Angeles region for this project, but, the URL in the web scraper can be provided for any search terms entered into Wedding Wire.
This tool works as of 7/1/23 but may not be updated for changes to the site structure or code that occurs within the target website.
