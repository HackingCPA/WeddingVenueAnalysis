# WeddingWebScraper
This is a quick project to scrape wedding venue price and name details from the Wedding Wire website (a popular marketplace for wedding venues and vendors) and export the file locally as a csv for use in other applications like dashboards.

I've focused on the Los Angeles region for this project, but, the URL can be provided for any search terms entered into Wedding Wire.
This tool works as of 7/1/23 but may not be updated for changes to the site structure or code that occurs within the target website.
